# house_cost_prediction_using_linear_regression
Overview

This project implements a House Cost Prediction Model using Linear Regression. The model takes in various features of a house (such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.) and predicts its price based on historical data.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for training.

Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features for prediction.

Model Training: Implementing and training a linear regression model.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Visualization: Plotting results to understand the model's effectiveness.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (Development Environment)

Installation

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Usage

Load the dataset in house_price_prediction.ipynb.

Run the data preprocessing steps.

Train the model using the provided training script.

Evaluate model performance and visualize the predictions.

Dataset

The dataset consists of features such as:

Square Footage

Number of Bedrooms

Number of Bathrooms

Location

Year Built

Ensure you have a proper dataset in CSV format (data/housing.csv) before running the project.

Model Performance

Uses Linear Regression to predict house prices.

Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
